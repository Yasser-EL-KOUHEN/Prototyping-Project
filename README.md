# Prototyping Project - Master Keyboard for Synthesizer

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and development of a **master keyboard for a synthesizer**, specifically the **Moog Mavis**. The goal was to create an ergonomic and functional input device that enhances the playing experience by incorporating a capacitive sensor-based pitch bend feature and a control voltage output for note selection.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains two key documents outlining the project's design, implementation, and results:

1. **Prototyping Project Report (`Prototyping Project - Yasser EL KOUHEN.pdf`)**  
   - A detailed **written report** explaining the project's motivation, methodology, hardware and software design, and testing results.
   - Sections include:
     - Introduction & problem statement
     - Signal acquisition & processing
     - Design and assembly of the keyboard
     - System integration & testing
     - Conclusion and future improvements
   
2. **Prototyping Presentation (`Prototyping Presentation - Yasser EL KOUHEN.pptx`)**  
   - A **presentation** summarizing the project's key components and findings.
   - Contains slides covering:
     - Project background
     - Signal conditioning circuit design
     - Capacitive sensor implementation
     - Control voltage generation
     - Summary of achievements and potential improvements

## Key Features of the Prototype
- **Capacitive touch keyboard:** Allows playing notes by detecting touch position.
- **Pitch bend control:** Detects hand proximity to vary pitch dynamically.
- **STM32 Nucleo-based processing:** Handles signal acquisition and control logic.
- **Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design:** Implemented for signal conditioning.
- **Moog Mavis compatibility:** Generates `1V/Oct` control voltage and `Gate` signals.

## Future Improvements
- Improve signal amplification for better pitch accuracy.
- Optimize sensor sensitivity to enhance user experience.
- Design a more robust PCB to avoid breadboard-related issues.
